## FOSS projects I use extensively

 * [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org) My daily driver. Provides a good combination of Cutting Edge and Stability.
 * [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) One does not simply exit Vim. 
 * [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) This blog uses Hugo.
 * [Kiera](https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera) Hugo theme used for this blog.
